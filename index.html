      <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>My name is Mason Bruning, I live in the most Southeastern part of Michigan's lower penninsula.
           I've lived in metro-Detroit for about 8 years; and not much can change my mind in thinking it's about the best city there is.
        </p>

    <section id="About me">
      <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm a college graduate from Oakland University; in northern metro-Detroit.
           I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering, with a major focus
           in Systems Administration, and interest with skill in theoretical mathematics.</p>
           
           <p>I've worked in the healthcare sector; where I grew an application database that was used just in the IT Architectural Dept.,
           to the source-of-truth for all application and project information in BCBSM.
           I've worked with open-source technologies to transcribe calls, APIs to handle all traffic within BCBSM Detroit's offices, and
           as a technical writer, DB associate and Business Analyst for BCBSM's AI tool.
           In the past year, I've received training from the United States Navy and gained more knowledge and experience in the 
           Customer Service/Help Desk parts of IT.</p>
                          
           <p>In my freetime I like to enjoy spending time with my wife and our 3 dogs; Honey, Denver and Hazelnut.
           I consider myself an amateur cinephile.
           And I enjoy my fair share of video games. My all time favorites being Halo, Skyrim, and Doom. But my go-to games that are more recent
           include Doom Eternal, Rainbow 6 Siege, Dead By Daylight, and Overwatch.
           Fun Fact: I used to drink about 3 pots of coffee a day. Yes. I said pots.</p>
